# Development

This plugin is developed with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)
and built with [Vito](https://vito.talk) — voice-driven development
([GitHub](https://github.com/vinceecniv/Vito)).

The transaction helpers speak a documented NDJSON event protocol — see
[PROTOCOL.md](PROTOCOL.md), which also carries the porting inventory for
non-dnf backends.

## Architecture

Update detection, check interval and ignored packages stay with DMS itself
(Settings → System Updater); this plugin consumes that state.

All release-note and HTML content from external sources is reduced to an
escaped minimal markup subset before rendering.

**Text worth copying can be selected**: release notes and the CVE numbers in
them, changelogs, descriptions, announcements, and the verbatim tool output
behind a failure; in an app's details popup also its name, the `old → new`
version step, the licence and a plugin's directory. Not every label — a
selectable element takes the mouse with it, and a card whose title was
selectable would stop being a card you can click.

### QML

| Piece | Role |
|---|---|
| `UpdaterWidget.qml` | Bar pill, popout, IPC, reboot logic, settings |
| `UpdaterWindow.qml` | Tabbed window (Updates / Installed / Install / Firmware / Log) |
| `UpdateEngine.qml` | Run orchestration (system packages → Flatpak → fwupd → AppImages → plugins → Homebrew → DMS packages) and per-package progress |
| `Backend.qml` | The package-backend seam: every entry point specific to the system package manager, plus how a privileged command is authorised |
| `UpdateCard.qml` | Rich per-update card |
| `InstalledView.qml` | Installed software browser + actions |
| `InstallView.qml` | Storefront + cross-source search & install |
| `FirmwareView.qml` | fwupd device inventory |
| `LogView.qml` | Action history browser |
| `AppDetailsDialog.qml` | Shared app-details popup (info, reviews, actions) |
| `SourcePickerDialog.qml` | Which source to install from, when an app has more than one |
| `OriginComparison.qml` | The sources side by side — version, size, sandbox, who stands behind it, which one is installed. Used by both the picker and the details popup, so the two cannot disagree |
| `AppimageOfferDialog.qml` | Installing an AppImage from a file or URL |
| `NewsDialog.qml` | Arch Linux announcements: unread, plus the archive |
| `RetrospectCard.qml` | The year the action log remembers, on the Updates dashboard |
| `MetadataStore.qml` | Async enrichment cache + held-state persistence |
| `ActionLog.qml` | Persistent action history (two-year retention) |
| `FirmwareService.qml` | fwupd update detection |
| `TintedIconEffect.qml` | Themed app icons, in one place because six views draw icons |
| `SelectableText.qml` | StyledText you can select and copy |
| `FieldPlaceholder.qml` | A hint that stays while a field is empty |
| `PhaseIndicator.qml` · `PulseRings.qml` | Material phase stepper; the shell's System Check pulse |
| `Tr.qml` | Plugin-local translation singleton |

### Python helpers

| Piece | Role |
|---|---|
| `scripts/enrich.py` | AppStream parsing, dnf fallbacks, holds, the search index (which is also the storefront), per-source versions, ODRS ratings, Flathub figures, upstream notes for git builds, caching, sanitizing |
| `scripts/rpm_helper.py` | libdnf5 transactions with exact byte progress |
| `scripts/ostree_helper.py` | rpm-ostree counterpart — atomic Fedora (layering, staged until reboot) |
| `scripts/apt_helper.py` · `scripts/pacman_helper.py` | python-apt and pyalpm counterparts (Arch: official repos, no AUR) |
| `scripts/pkg_backend.py` | Per-distro metadata backend (search, sizes, inventory, holds, changelogs); also which packages own a launchable desktop entry |
| `scripts/flatpak_helper.py` | libflatpak transactions with exact byte progress, and end-of-life detection |
| `scripts/appimage.py` | AppImage catalog, install/replace/update/uninstall, GitHub update sources, folder scanning, the `.appimage` association |
| `scripts/repo_backend.py` | Software sources: repositories and Flatpak remotes, Copr, RPM Fusion, Flathub (dnf family only) |
| `scripts/brew_helper.py` | Homebrew: installed, outdated, upgrade — per-formula events read out of brew's own prose |
| `scripts/arch_news.py` | The Arch news feed: fetch, reduce, archive, track what has been read |
| `scripts/action_log.py` · `scripts/reconcile.py` | Log append/prune; comparing install times against the log to find what changed outside this app |
| `scripts/interp.py` | Re-exec under an interpreter that can see the distro's bindings — a pyenv or virtualenv python3 cannot |
| `scripts/simulate.py` | Record an update run and play it back (below) |
| `scripts/open.sh` | What the desktop entry runs: finds `dms` on a launcher's narrower PATH, and turns a failed call into a notification instead of silence |

### Checks

Everything in CI runs on any distribution, with the network and the package
managers stubbed: `check_translations.py` (the 15 catalogs against the QML),
`test_dep11.py`, `test_gitnotes.py`, `test_reconcile.py`, `test_ostree_helper.py`,
`test_arch_news.py`, `test_brew_helper.py`, `test_pacman_helper.py`,
`test_flatpak_helper.py`, `test_simulate.py`, and `test_shell_portability.py` —
which reads every `sh -c` snippet in the QML for bash-only syntax, because
`/bin/sh` is dash on Debian and Ubuntu and a bashism there produces no error,
only wrong output.

## Recording a run, and playing it back

Nothing the updater window draws comes from the system directly: every phase,
row, byte counter and error arrives as NDJSON on some helper's stdout. So a
recording of those streams is a recording of everything the window can show,
and playing one back puts the whole interface through a real run — same rows,
same order, same pauses — without root, without a network, and without waiting
for a distribution to ship thirty updates. Otherwise the visual side of a run
can only be worked on when there happens to be something to install, and then
only once, because installing it is what makes it stop being pending.

The seam is one function: every process a run starts asks
`Backend.instrument()` for its command and gets back the real one, the real one
wrapped in a recorder, or `scripts/simulate.py` reading a recording. The engine
above it cannot tell which — a simulation taking a different path through the
engine would be a simulation of a different program.

Under the gear, on a working copy only, there is a **Developer** section: arm
*Record the next update run*, update as usual, and the run lands in
`recordings/`. Each recording is then a row with a **Play** button and a
playback speed. The same without the mouse:

```sh
dms ipc call dankSoftwareDepotDev record on          # arm the recorder
dms ipc call dankSoftwareDepotDev recordings         # what is on disk
dms ipc call dankSoftwareDepotDev simulate run-20260905-101500
dms ipc call dankSoftwareDepotDev simstatus          # where a replay stalled
dms ipc call dankSoftwareDepotDev simulate off
```

A working copy means the plugin directory is a symlink — the same test the
self-update makes before refusing to update a checkout. The dev IPC target is
`enabled:` on it, and a handler that is not enabled registers nothing, so a
normal install neither lists it in `dms ipc show` nor can call it.

A recording is a directory: `meta.json` holds what was pending when it was
taken (the daemon cannot be asked afterwards — the packages are installed), and
one `<pass>.jsonl` per stream, each line carrying its own timestamp. They are
gitignored, being one machine's package inventory at one moment; `git add -f`
one worth sharing.

Two things a replay leaves out, both for want of a stream of ours to record:
the shell's own packages, which go through the DMS daemon, and anything a
simulated run would otherwise write down — the action log, the reboot notice,
the "last updated" time and the duration estimate all sit out a replay, because
none of it happened.

Recording is deliberately hard to fail with: it sits between the shell and a
transaction that is really installing packages, so anything that goes wrong
setting up the recording falls through to running the command untouched.

One thing to know when working on `Backend.qml`: it is a QML singleton, and
`dms ipc call plugins reload` rebuilds the widget while keeping the singleton.
Changes to it need the shell itself restarted.
