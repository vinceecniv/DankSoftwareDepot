# Exec target of the desktop entry, standing in for a bare `dms ipc call`.
#
# The entry used to run `dms` straight from PATH and trust the exit code.
# Both halves of that were wrong. A launcher passes on neither stderr nor a
# missing command, so an entry that could not find `dms` did nothing at all
# — no window, no error, nothing to look at. And `dms ipc call` answers 0
# even when it reached nobody: it prints "Target not found." and succeeds.
# Any output at all is the failure; silence is the success.
#
#   open.sh            open the window
#   open.sh <file>     open it on the AppImage that was double-clicked
